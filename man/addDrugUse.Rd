\arguments{
\item{cohort}{Cohort in the cdm}

\item{cdm}{deprecated}

\item{ingredientConceptId}{Ingredient OMOP concept that we are interested for
the study. It is a compulsory input, no default value is provided.}

\item{conceptSet}{List of concepts to be included. If NULL all the
descendants of ingredient concept id will be used.}

\item{duration}{Whether to add duration related columns.}

\item{quantity}{Whether to add quantity related columns.}

\item{dose}{Whether to add dose related columns.}

\item{gapEra}{Number of days between two continuous exposures to be
considered in the same era.}

\item{eraJoinMode}{How two different continuous exposures are joined in an
era. There are four options:
"zero" the exposures are joined considering that the period between both
continuous exposures the subject is treated with a daily dose of zero. The
time between both exposures contributes to the total exposed time.
"join" the exposures are joined considering that the period between both
continuous exposures the subject is treated with a daily dose of zero. The
time between both exposures does not contribute to the total exposed time.
"previous" the exposures are joined considering that the period between both
continuous exposures the subject is treated with the daily dose of the
previous subexposure. The time between both exposures contributes to the
total exposed time.
"subsequent" the exposures are joined considering that the period between
both continuous exposures the subject is treated with the daily dose of the
subsequent subexposure. The time between both exposures contributes to the
total exposed time.}

\item{overlapMode}{How the overlapping between two exposures that do not
start on the same day is solved inside a subexposure. There are five possible
options:
"previous" the considered daily_dose is the one of the earliest exposure.
"subsequent" the considered daily_dose is the one of the new exposure that
starts in that subexposure.
"minimum" the considered daily_dose is the minimum of all of the exposures in
the subexposure.
"maximum" the considered daily_dose is the maximum of all of the exposures in
the subexposure.
"sum" the considered daily_dose is the sum of all the exposures present in
the subexposure.}

\item{sameIndexMode}{How the overlapping between two exposures that start on
the same day is solved inside a subexposure. There are three possible options:
"minimum" the considered daily_dose is the minimum of all of the exposures in
the subexposure.
"maximum" the considered daily_dose is the maximum of all of the exposures in
the subexposure.
"sum" the considered daily_dose is the sum of all the exposures present in
the subexposure.}

\item{imputeDuration}{Whether/how the duration should be imputed
"none", "median", "mean", "mode" or a number}

\item{imputeDailyDose}{Whether/how the daily_dose should be imputed
"none", "median", "mean", "mode" or a number}

\item{durationRange}{Range between the duration must be comprised. It should
be a numeric vector of length two, with no NAs and the first value should be
equal or smaller than the second one. It must not be NULL if imputeDuration
is not "none". If NULL no restrictions are applied.}

\item{dailyDoseRange}{Range between the daily_dose must be comprised. It
should be a numeric vector of length two, with no NAs and the first value
should be equal or smaller than the second one. It must not be NULL if
imputeDailyDose is not "none". If NULL no restrictions are applied.}
