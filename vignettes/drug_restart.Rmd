  # Introduction
  
  Obtaining information on drug restart or switching to another drug after discontinuation of the original treatment is often of interest in drug utilization studies. In this vignette, we show how to assess drug switching and restart with this package.
  
  # Data
  
  ## Connect to mock data
  
  For this vignette we will use mock data contained in the DrugUtilisation package. 
  
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DrugUtilisation)
library(CDMConnector)
library(CodelistGenerator)
library(PatientProfiles)
library(dplyr)

cdm <- mockDrugUtilisation(numberIndividual  = 200)
```

## Generate study cohorts

We will examine the patterns of drug restart and switching among patients taking metformin as an example. Specifically, we will investigate whether patients restart metformin after discontinuation, switch to insulin, try both medications, or remain untreated.

For this we will need two cohorts: one of patients exposed to metformin and another of patients exposed to insulin. 


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# codelists
metformin <- getDrugIngredientCodes(cdm = cdm, name = "metformin")
insulin <- getDrugIngredientCodes(cdm = cdm, name = "insulin detemir")

cdm <- generateDrugUtilisationCohortSet(
  cdm = cdm, name = "metformin", conceptSet = metformin
)
cdm$metformin |> cohortCount()

cdm <- generateDrugUtilisationCohortSet(
  cdm = cdm, name = "insulin", conceptSet = insulin
)
cdm$insulin |> cohortCount()
```

## Assess drug restart

The function `summariseDrugRestart()` calculated how many of the following events are given in a treatment cohort:

- restart the same treatment 

- switch to other treatments 

- restart the same treatment but aslo switch to another

- not treated anymore (neither original treatment or potential switch)

The figure below illustratiates this analysis where we study what happens after the first exposure to a certain drug (in blue), considering a specific switch drug (orange). In that example, we are interested in know what happens in the firsts 100, 180 and 365 days of treatment discontinuation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="80%", warning=FALSE}
library(here)
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/drug_restart_A.png"))
```

Now, let's use the function to assess metformin restart and switch to insulin after the first metformin treatment.

```{r}
results <- summariseDrugRestart(
  cohort = cdm$metformin,
  switchCohortTable = "insulin",
  switchCohortId = NULL,
  strata = list(),
  followUpDays = Inf,
  censorDate = NULL,
  restrictToFirstDiscontinuation = TRUE
)

results |> glimpse()
```

We could be interested in getting these results in different follow-up periods since the first metformin exposure ended. For instance, next we get the results in the first 180 days, the first year, and until the end of observation.

```{r}
results <- summariseDrugRestart(
  cohort = cdm$metformin,
  switchCohortTable = "insulin",
  switchCohortId = NULL,
  strata = list(),
  followUpDays = c(180, 365, Inf),
  censorDate = NULL,
  restrictToFirstDiscontinuation = TRUE
)
```

Other options that this function allows are:

- **restrictToFirstDiscontinuation**

By default this argument is set to TRUE, which means that we only consider the firsts exposure of the subject. If FALSE, the analysis is conducted on a record level, considering all exposures in the cohort, as the following image illustrates:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="80%", warning=FALSE}
library(here)
knitr::include_graphics(here("vignettes/figures/drug_restart_B.png"))
```

- **censorEndDate**

This argument allows to stop considering restart and switch events after a certain date, which must specified as a column in the cohort.

- **strata**

This argumnet must be a list pointing to columns or combinations of columns in the cohort to use as strata. It will produce stratified estimates as well as for the overall cohort.

For instance, we reporduce the last calculation but this time straifying by sex. We first use PatientProfiles to add a column indicating the sex, which later we use in strata.

```{r}
results <- cdm$cohort1 |>
  addSex() |>
  summariseDrugRestart(
    switchCohortTable = "insulin",
    switchCohortId = NULL,
    strata = list("sex"),
    followUpDays = c(180, 365, Inf),
    censorDate = NULL,
    restrictToFirstDiscontinuation = TRUE
  )
```

## Visualise drug restart

The package has table and plot functions to help visualizing the results from `summariseDrugRestart()`.

### Table

The function `tableDrugRestart()` will create a gt, flextable or tibble table from the summarised_result object created with `summariseDrugRestart()`. This function offers multiple customization options to format the resulting table according to the user preferences.

```{r}
tableDrugRestart(
  result = results,
  header = c("strata"),
  splitStrata = TRUE,
  cohortName = TRUE,
  cdmName = FALSE,
  groupColumn = c("cohort_name"),
  type = "gt",
  formatEstimateName = c(`N (%)` = "<count> (<percentage> %)"),
  .options = list()
)
```

### Plot

The `plotDrugRestart()` function creates a bar plot depicting the percentage of drug restart events for each cohort, stratum, and follow-up time (specified in the variable_name column of the summarised result). This function offers customization options for colours, facetting, and handling of strata.

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
plotDrugRestart(
  result = results,
  facetX = "variable_name",
  facetY = c("cohort_name", "strata"),
  colour = "variable_level",
  splitStrata = TRUE
)
```
