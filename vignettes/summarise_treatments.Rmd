# Introduction

The DrugUtilisation package incorporates a function to summarise the
dose table over multiple cohorts: `summariseTreatment()`. In this
vignette, we will explore the functionalities and usages of this
function.

## Create mock table

We will use mock data contained in the package thoughout the vignette. Let's
modify cohort tables `cohort1` and `cohort2` in our mock dataset, so the frist
includes 3 subcohorts of health conditions, while the second contains three 
treatments.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DrugUtilisation)
library(CDMConnector)
library(dplyr)
library(PatientProfiles)

cdm <- mockDrugUtilisation(numberIndividual = 200)

new_cohort_set <- settings(cdm$cohort1) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(cohort_definition_id) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(cohort_name = c("asthma","bronchitis","pneumonia"))

cdm$cohort1 <- cdm$cohort1 |>
  newCohortTable(cohortSetRef = new_cohort_set)

new_cohort_set <- settings(cdm$cohort2) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(cohort_definition_id) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(cohort_name = c("albuterol","fluticasone","montelukast"))

cdm$cohort2 <- cdm$cohort2 |>
  newCohortTable(cohortSetRef = new_cohort_set)

```


Notice that `cohort1` is a cohort with three subcohorts representing
three different conditions:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
settings(cdm$cohort1)
```

And `cohort2` is a cohort with three different treatments:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
settings(cdm$cohort2)
```

# Summarise treatment with summariseTreatmentFromCohort() function

`summariseTreatmentFromCohort()` function creates a standarised tibble
summarising the treatment information (already specified in an existing cohort) over multiple cohorts. There are three mandatory arguments:

1.  `cohort`: cohort from the cdm object.
2.  `treatmentCohortName`: name of the treatment cohort's table.
3.  `window`: list of the windows where to summarise the treatments.

See an example of its usage below, where we use
`summariseTreatmentFromCohort()` to summarise treatments defined in
`cohort2` in the cohorts defined in `cohort1`.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summariseTreatmentFromCohort(cohort = cdm$cohort1,
                   treatmentCohortName = c("cohort2"),
                   window = list(c(0,0), c(1,30)))
```

## strata parameter

We can also stratify our cohort and calculate the estimates within each
strata group by using the `strata` parameter.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cdm[["cohort1"]] <- cdm[["cohort1"]] %>%
  addSex() %>%
  addAge(ageGroup = list("<40" = c(0, 39), ">40" = c(40, 150)))

summariseTreatmentFromCohort(cohort = cdm$cohort1,
                   treatmentCohortName = c("cohort2"),
                   window = list(c(0,0)),
                   treatmentCohortId = 1,
                   strata = list("sex" = "sex", "age" = "age_group")
                   )
```

Notice that we have also used the `treatmentCohortId` parameter to
specify that we only want to explore `albuterol` across the cohorts defined in
`cohort1`.

## combination parameter

Soon, you will be able to include combinations of different treatments
by using the `combination` argument. Unfortunately, it has not been
implemented yet, stay tuned for the next release! ðŸ˜„


# Summarise treatment with `summariseTreatmentFromConceptSet()` function

`summariseTreatmentFromCohort()` can be used when we have already
created our treatment cohort. However, if that is not the case, we can
use `summariseTreatmentFromConceptSet()` to avoid creating a new cohort
before using this function. The following arguments have to be provided:

1.  `cohort`: cohort from the cdm object.
2.  `treatmentConceptSet`: list with the treatments' concepts sets.
3.  `window`: list of the windows where to summarise the treatments.

Unfortunately, is not implemented yet. Stay in the loop for the next
release!ðŸ˜‰
